# led-wall-clock-iobroker
A RGB LED matrix wall clock controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
Modified original project from jeffkub - removed temperature and humidity retrieval from a Internet site and changed to local retrieval from my iobroker smarthome platform. Localisation to Germany: changed the clock format to 24H, temperature to Celsius.
The LOCALE setting of the Raspberry is used for the date display language.
Using the WiFi module of the "RPi Zero W" for the network / Internet connection.
Display color of temperature / humidity is changing depending from their values (values out of "healthy" range --> red color).

```
apt install ntp
```
Python libraries
- [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)
- requests
- apscheduler
- daemonify

ioBroker Adapters (http://www.iobroker.net/)

- iobroker.web (required by simple-api)


# RGB Matrix Library Build Instructions
Clone this repository and submodules to your Raspberry Pi
```
apt install git python-dev python-pip
cd /opt
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gituser-rk/led-wall-clock-iobroker.git
cd led-wall-clock-iobroker/rpi-rgb-led-matrix
```

Build and install the Python library
```
make build-python
sudo make install-python
sudo pip install daemonify requests apscheduler ephem
```
# Starting the Clock
To start the clock for testing
```
cd /opt/led-wall-clock-iobroker
sudo ./ledclock.py
```
To start the clock as a daemon
```
cd /opt/led-wall-clock-iobroker
sudo ./ledclock.py -d start
```
# To Do
- change value retrieval from "iobroker.simple-api" to mqtt-subscriber
- Move configuration to a separate file
- Implement dimming based on some I2C ambient light sensor
